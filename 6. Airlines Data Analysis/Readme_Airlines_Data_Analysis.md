# Airlines Data Analysis

Since the disappearance of MH370 in 2014 and two Boeing 737 crashes, first in 2018 and second just 5 months later, there has been fear in public and concerns about the air travel safety. However, despite this increased attention we’ve seen in media reports, these numbers do not really represent any increasing trends. On the contrary, we’ve seen the opposite trend as airline accidents have continued to decrease over time.

## Design

I have chosen Power BI for creation of below data visualizations:
1. Donut Chart
    I have divided the period between two groups, 1985-1999 and 2000-2014, and then compared the Air Traffic Fatalities between them. This shows, how fatalities have reduced almost to half during 2000-2014 as compared to 1985-1999. Hence, showing how the air traffic has become more safer over the period of time.
2. Line Chart – Fatalities by Year
    This chart shows total Number of Fatalities from 1920 to 2020. From the plot it is evident how Air Fatalities have reduced from 5k in 1940 to 0.5k in 2020. I have created a filter to filter out years between 1920 and 2020 as there is insignificantly less data for rest of the years.
3. Bar Chart – Air Traffic by Year
    This chart shows total air traffic from 1970 to 2020. From the plot it is evident how Air Fatalities have reduced significantly in last 50 years. From above line chart and this bar chart, it is evident that Fatalities have reduced when air traffic has increased multiple folds over the period of time which in term depicts that air traffic has become safer.
4. Line Chart – Passenger & Revenue
    This chart is showing the Passenger count as well as Revenue as two different lines over the same period range. This shows how the passengers and revenues have shown to grow over the period and air travel has become more and more popular.
5. Horizontal Bar chart – Fatalities by Each Airline
    Comparison of Total Fatalities by group of years, 1985-1999 and 2000-2014, for each Airline.
    Chose bar chart because it shows best comparison between two groups for each airline. For example, Malaysian Airlines had more fatalities between 2000-2014 as compared to 1985-1999.
6. Horizontal bar chart - Available Seat KM Flown Every Week (Billions) by Airline
    This bar chat shows the sheer volume airlines experienced on a weekly basis.
